\section{Valley Cafe Feedback}
We had the chance to present an early prototype of the application to entrepeneurs at the Fontys Valley Cafe on May 28th 2015.
The companies had a chance to take a look at an early version of the prototype. Their feedback was positive. They see big future in the idea of monitoring exercises, but recommended setting the focus more on the rehabilitation exercises than on the fitness area. In general all company visitors see a big future in monitoring exercises in the aging society we ( will ) live in.
