Fitness applications have been around for several years. They calculate steps and heart-rate in your every day life and tell you how many calories you have burned.

Recently there have been developments with using wearables in the healthcare area. Wearables are technologies that are worn on the body. There are several different kinds of wearables like wristbands, belts, suits, chokers and soles. Combined with fitness applications, the precise measurement of human movements is possible.

Exercise Control focuses on arm movements. It measures the current position and movements executed. In Physiotherapy an injured person would execute a training, which Exercise Control then calculates and checks, whether the training was executed correct or not.
