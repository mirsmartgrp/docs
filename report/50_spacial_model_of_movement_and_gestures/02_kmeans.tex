\subsection{Application of K-Means}
The K-Means algorithm is used to train the Hidden Markov Models. With K-Means all the data sequences from training this exercise are used to calculate the means. Each mean from the K-Means algorithm represents the center of one of the five states of the Hidden Markov Model. The data used to initialised the algorithm is every data element from the training phase (three dimensional data from accelerartion + position).
