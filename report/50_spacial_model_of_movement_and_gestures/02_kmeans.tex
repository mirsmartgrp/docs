\subsection{Application of K-Means}
The K-Means algorithm was used to train the Hidden Markov Models. With K-Means all the data sequences from training this exercise were used to calculate the means. Each mean from the K-Means algorithm represented the center of one of the five states of the Hidden Markov Model. The data used to initialised the algorithm was every data element from the training phase (three dimansional data from acclerartion + position).
