\subsection{Discussion}
One thing that gave us some problem was the storing of data, for example the json files, that records the exercise data that is used to calculate the correct movement. We saved them in loose files, which later made it difficult to make sure they were not changed while running the application. We discussed using a server and database to have videos and instructions for the exercises that can then be downloaded one by one. Saved data then would be available, even when the devices are offline, but cost some diskspace. The problem is now that we have to rewrite parts of our coruse when we want to use a server for the application because currently everything is built on having the needed data only local.

Another problem we had during developing the application was that, as far as we know, Android Wear and for mobile needs to be in one project. This way they get the same store id. That means we had to develop these two parts in one project and could not seperate them completly. While this was not that much of a problem in practice, we would have like to work on them independently.

In developing the GUI, we decided to be more focused on the function than the form. This lead to the GUI, only working correctly in portrait format. The landscape format has many problems. In future we should at least consider other formats when developing so it would not be a big problem later when things need to get changed.


While we wrote some tests in the beginning mostly for the connection between phone and wear. We did not write complete test that could be run automaticly. This lead to us testing manual by using the application directly. This made testing only possible if the interface was already implemented for the to be tested part.
Because of this missmanagement the GUI was developed side by side. While this worked reasonably well for a while, the problem was that we later changed some aspect of the application and had to change some parts of the GUI as well.
We also had the problem that parts of the application that were not covered by the GUI would not, or not enough tested. This results to a completely new problem shortly, before development was finished that had to be found and fixed in a very limited time frame.
In future we would write test that are not dependend on the GUI but work independed.
