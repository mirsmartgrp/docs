The smartphone \textit{Android} application provides a user interface allowing the user to obtain information about available exercises including a video demonstration as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:smpui}.The main purpose, however, is to compare sensory data obtained from the coupled smartwatch against already existing data to determine the degree to which the user has performed the exercise correctly. The computed result is then shown on the smartwatch for user convenience as shown in figure \ref{fig:smwui}.Before the application can determine the degree of correctness for a given exercise, the user has to perform the exercise correctly a number of times to train the algorithm used within the application. This is preferably done in the presence of a qualified personal trainer or physiotherapist.Not yet implemented is a statistical overview which allows the user to view his or her own progress within a given time span. This feature is not solely for the user but also for qualified personnel to verify adequate progress.The smartphone application also offers a historical statistics view where the user's progress can be viewed by the user him- or herself or by qualified personnel to verify adequate progress.
