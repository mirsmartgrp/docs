\section{Communication}
Smartphone and smartwatch communicate with each other via a Bluetooth connection, which is to be established and sustained during the runtime of both applications.Without going into too much detail, the communication interface of \textit{Android Wear} and \textit{Tizen} are different. The \textit{Android} smartphone application supports both interfaces and selectively chooses the appropriate interface for the platform used on the smartwatch end.The main purpose of the Bluetooth connection is to outsource the resource-hungry algorithm required for the evaluation and comparison of collected sensory data to the smartphone application since a smartphone still possesses more suitable resources than a smartwatch does.Furthermore, the smartphone application supplies the available exercises to the smartwatch application to give the user a choice to which exercise to perform. The exercise list is obtained by the smartphone application from a centralized server providing exercise descriptions and video instructions.
