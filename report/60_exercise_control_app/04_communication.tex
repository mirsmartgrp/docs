\section{Communication}

Smart phone and smart watch communicate with each other via a bluetooth
connection which is to be established and sustained during the runtime of both
applications.

Without going into too much detail, the communication interface
of \textit{Android Wear} and \textit{Tizen} are different. The \textit{Android}
smart phone application supports both interfaces and selectively chooses the
appropriate interface for the platform used on the smart watch end.

The main purpose of the bluetooth connection is to outsource the
resource-hungry algorithm required for the evaluation and comparison of
collected sensory data to the smart phone application since a smart phone still
possesses more suitable resources than a smart watch does.

Furthermore, the smartphone application supplies the available exercises to
the smartwatch application to give the user a choice to which exercise to
perform. The exercise list is obtained by the smartphone application from a
centralized server providing exercise descriptions and video instructions.
