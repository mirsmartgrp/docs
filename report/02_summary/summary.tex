\hfill{\Huge Summary}\\
This report provides the process of creating an innovative kind of application for wearables in healthcare and fitness.The creation process begins with the problem of healthcare applications currently available and continues with a comparison of common device in use at this time. Following, decisions are made which hardware is used to test and run the application on. \newlineThe report also includes the major problem of handling and analyzing raw sensor data in a spatial model of movement and how it was solve, that includes: \newline- Filtering of raw data and avoiding garbage data \newline- The k-Means algorithm used to train the Hidden Markov Models \newline- The Hidden Markov Model to analyze the movements\newlineConcluding the report, the application itself is described and shown. Tests executed by outside users are evaluated on how they experienced it, what the think can be improved and what they liked.\newlineAll in all making use of the three techniques helps solve the problem of handling raw data in a spatial model. The current achieved accuracy is not perfect, but this can be solving in the future by optimization.The user tests have shown, that the GUI of the application is easy to understand, but the description and the video of an exercise need to be improved.
