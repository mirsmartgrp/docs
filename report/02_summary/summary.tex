\hfill{\Huge Summary}\\

This report provides the process of creating an innovative kind of application for wearables in healthcare and fitness.
The creation process begins with the problem of healthcare applications currently available and continues with a comparison of common device in use at this time. Following, decisions are made which hardware is used to test and run the application on. \newline
The report also includes the major problem of handling and analysing raw sensor data in a spacial model of movement and how it was solve, that includes: \newline
- filtering of raw data and avoiding garbage data \newline
- the k-Means algorithm used to train the Hidden Markov Models \newline
- the Hidden Markov Model to analyse the movements
\newline

Concluding the report, the application itself is described and shown. Tests executed by outside users are evaluated on how it was experienced, what can be improved and what worked well.
\newline

All in all making use of the three techniques helps solve the problem of handling raw data in a spacial model. The current achieved accuracy is not perfect, but this can be solve in the future by optimisation.
The user tests have shown, that the GUI of the application is easy to understand, but the description and the video of an exercise need to be improved.
