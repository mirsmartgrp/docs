\hfill{\Huge Summary}\\

subject matter

This report provides the process of creating an innovative kind of application for wearables in healthcare and fitness.

Content

The creation process begins with the problem of healthcare applications currently available and continues with a comparison of common device in use at this time. Following, decisions are made which hardware is used to test and run the application on.

The report also includes the major problem of handling and analysing raw sensor data in a spacial model of movement and how it was solve, that includes:
- filtering of raw data and avoiding garbage data
- the k-Means algorithm used to train the Hidden Markov Models
- the Hidden Markov Model to analyse the movements



Conclusions
